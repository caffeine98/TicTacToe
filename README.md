# TicTacToe
This is a simple TicTacToe program written in C, using the SDL library.

# Dependencies
- SDL2

# Build
Use the TicTacToe.sln file and build using Visual Studio 2022. Ensure the library is added to your project properties in Visual Studio.

# Resources used
This is heavily based on Tsoding's video on comparing procedural programming and functional programming, so all credit goes to him. I wrote this as a way to better learn the library itself.
